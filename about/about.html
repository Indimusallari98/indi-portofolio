        <p id="about-p">I am Indi Musallari and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in the North
            of Albania in a small
            town called Shkodra. I have finished an Austrian High School in Shkodra three years ago and I
            decided to finish my studies in Canada. When I came to Canada I started to study French at UQAM
            University and I finished my studies at UQAM University last year. Instead of Albanian, that is
            my
            mother tongue I can speak English, French and German fluently and I also have knowledge in the
            Turkish language.
            Instead of my studies, my passions are fashion design and makeup. My interest in fashion
            started
            since I was a little. I always liked to dress up with the latest trends and to combine
            different
            designs and colors. Before two years I started to watch makeup tutorials and I opened a
            personal
            blog on Instagram to share my interests with my followers. I post pictures on my Instagram
            every
            week and I also like to influence my followers with my fashion design and trends. </p>
